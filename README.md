# Project Title: JAVA File Manipulation Tool  

### Description  
This is a command-line tool developed in Java to perform basic file manipulation tasks. The tool includes the following features:  

1. **List Files**: Display the names of all files in a specified directory with various conditions.  
2. **Copy Files**: Copy a file from one location to another.  
3. **Delete Files**: Delete a specified file.  
4. **Concatenate Files**: Combine the contents of two text files into a new file.  

### Implementation Details  
Below are some guiding questions and insights to implement the tool:  

1. **Listing Files**  
   - How would you implement the functionality to list all files in a specified directory in Java?  
   - Can you provide the code snippet for recursively listing files in subdirectories?  
   - How to sort the listed files alphabetically?  
   - Is it possible to filter the listed files based on a specific file extension? If yes, how would you implement this?  
   - How to find hidden files?  
   - What types of exceptions might occur when listing files, and how would you handle them in your code?  

2. **Copying Files**  
   - Explain how you would copy a file from one location to another using Java.  

3. **Deleting Files**  
   - Describe your approach to deleting a specified file using Java.  

4. **Concatenating Files**  
   - How could you concatenate the contents of two text files into a new file using Java?  

### Error Handling  
- Enhance your code to provide informative error messages in case of issues such as insufficient permissions or invalid directory paths.
